# Overview



The Client API (xxDK) is the client-side software for communicating with the cMix network, a privacy-protecting layer within the larger [xx network](https://xx.network/) blockchain ecosystem. cMix builds on current data protection mechanisms by extending security beyond just content to include metadata — the what, when, where, and how of user activity.

To learn more about the cMix protocol and what it offers, a good place to start is [the cMix whitepaper](https://xx.network/xxcMixwhitepaper.pdf).

The xxDK helps developers provide unparalleled privacy for their users by implementing xx network messaging features such as end-to-end encryption and metadata protection. It comes with an API library and related command-line facilities that enable developers to build full-featured xx clients for all platforms. Additionally, the base messaging protocols can be extended.

Some use cases for integrating the API into your applications include (but are not limited to) building:

- Banking applications
- Voting applications, such as [Votexx](https://votexx.org/)
- Secure messaging apps for private communication, such as [xx messenger](https://xx.network/messenger/)

The xxDK supports golang versions 1.17 or newer. You can find the most recent version on [Gitlab](https://git.xx.network/elixxir/client).
